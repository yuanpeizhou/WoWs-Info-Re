# [IJN ship names](https://github.com/HenryQuan/WoWs-Info-Re/blob/API/json/alias.json)
This was created because the official API doesn't have them. I used kongzhong.com's data but I am adding new ship names manually now. This can be used for both Japanese and Chinese users.


# [Personal Rating](https://github.com/HenryQuan/WoWs-Info-Re/blob/API/json/personal_rating.json)
From https://wows-numbers.com/personal/rating/expected/json/, this is to prevent frequent requests to wows-number.com.

# [3D models](https://github.com/HenryQuan/WoWs-Info-Re/blob/API/json/model.json)
